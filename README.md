# Visualize Path Finding Algorithms!
I have created a Path Finder Visualizer using pure js. This interactive tool showcases various pathfinding algorithms, allowing users to experiment with custom mazes and witness algorithms in action.

## Algorithms used:
Breath First Search </br>
Bidirectional Search </br>
Greedy Best First Search </br>
Dijikstra </br>
A *</br>

## How it works?

***Note: Nodes are the small square boxes of the mesh(net like structure)***
In the Mesh you will find Start Node(<img src="./assets/icon/source.svg">) and End Node(<img src="./assets/icon/target.svg">)<br/>
***Start Node indicates starting point of the path***</br>
***End Node indictaes end point of the path***</br>
You can create obstracle/walls between start node and end node simply by clicking on nodes.Walls are shown in blue color<br/>
Now you are all set,just click on Visulaize Button!!<br/>
_You can customize algorithm,pixel and speed accordingly_
